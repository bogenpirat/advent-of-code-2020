# advent-of-code-2020
my solutions for the [advent of code 2020](https://adventofcode.com/2020) challenge in python.

solution files start off with the input given by the challenge in a multi-line string. 
this is typically split into individual points of data and normalized until the implemented algorithm(s) can operate on it.

the two parts are typically implemented separately except where the code remains legible when the two parts are integrated into one solution.
